    "Imagine you have a large corpus and a large number of queries of the form “_Give me all documents in which all of the words x, y and  z appear_”. One way to answer such queries efficiently is to index the documents in the corpus: for instance implement a function called `index()` for which `index(document, word)` returns non-zero if and only if word occurs in document at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to implement this kind of index is with a matrix in which each line corresponds to a document and each column corresponds to a word. When the query above is executed, only the lines for which the entries on the x, y and z columns are simultaneously not zero are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this matrix is number of documents × number of distinct words that appear in the corpus. Clearly, the smaller the matrix, the faster the queries are executed. Ideally, we would like to reduce the number of words while not losing the ability to answer queries. One way to do this is to eliminate morphological variability — for instance, map both “_goes_” and “_went_” to the same column “_go_”. This is called \"_lemmatization_\". Part-of-speech tagging can help lemmatization so as not to confuse similar surface forms with different roles (e.g. not confuse \"_can_\" as in \"_a can of beer_\" as opposed to \"_I can do it_\".).\n",

    "You have probably found a surprising result on our sample sentence and very low accuracy for the bigram tagger, when run alone. If you run the trained bigram tagger on a sentence it has not seen during training (e.g. bigram.tag(raw_sents[1]), you will notice that a majority of words will be tagged as “None”. When the bigram tagger encounters a new word, it is unable to assign a tag. It will also be unable to tag the following word — even if it was seen during training — because it was never seen preceded by a “None” tag. From this point on, all the words up to the end of the sentence will be tagged as “None” for the same reason. This explains the low accuracy of the bigram tagger when run alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that arises when using n-grams is that once we pass to larger values of n, more data is needed for training, as the specificity of the context increases. In other words, there are many more possible bigrams than unigrams and thus the word/tag combinations that we need to consider when tagging are less likely to have appeared in the training set, as n increases. This is known as the sparse data problem, and is quite pervasive in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, when using n-gram taggers, we encounter the following tradeoff: having n large means more accurate predictions, at the cost of having to provide more training data; having a smaller n, leads to not so accurate predictions, but less necessary training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to overcome this limitation, we can train a bigram tagger that falls back on our “unigram+default” or “unigram+regexp” taggers defined in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try this out now (an example for a bigram tagger with fallback on “unigram+default” can be found in the book, [section 5.5.4 “_Combining Taggers_”](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html#combining-taggers)). Does this improve performance?\n",
    "* What about adding a trigram tagger that falls back on the “bigram+unigram+default” or on “bigram+unigram+regexp”?  "
